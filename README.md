# ikea-product-scrapper

We have to scrap the website https://www.ikea.com/ using BeautifulSoup. So i have
written a script which will take product’s URL as a list [Bed, Table, Chair, Lighting]
and scrapped all the content inside it. you can modify the list Url as per your convince 

After downloading the images using that script in the second part, I have created 2
folders, one for the train set and the other for the test set. In the training set, a
train.csv file, and an image folder
● The .csv file contains the names of all the training images and their
corresponding true labels
● The image folder has all the training images.
The .csv file in our test set is different from the one present in the training set. This
test set .csv file contains the names of all the test images, but they do not have any
corresponding labels.


This demo script will help you to do a classification model and get you started with web scrapping.
